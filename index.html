                    <p>Community resistance to new housing is a cause of housing supply shortfalls in cities around the United States. Citizens differ on the desirable rate and nature of housing growth. I argue that two types of political beliefs shape support for housing growth. Localism is the belief that the interests of established members of the local community should be privileged relative to those of newcomers and outsiders. Liberalism is the belief that economic outcomes should be equitable. I draw on an original survey experiment and rich observational data on land use ballot measures in San Francisco to show that liberals' support for housing growth is moderated by the type of housing being produced.  Localism, on the other hand, is negatively associated with support for housing growth, regardless of the type of development being proposed.</p>

            		<p>I propose the status quo bias hypothesis, which predicts that housing wealth increases preference for status quo arrangements with respect to Social Security. I contrast the status quo bias hypothesis with the claim that housing wealth reduces support for social insurance, and test the hypothesis using an original survey experiment and observational data from the 2000-2004 ANES panel. The evidence suggests that housing wealth's conservatizing effect should be interpreted as a status quo preference, rather than opposition to redistributive social policies.</p>

              Type: Evidence from a New Tariff-line Dataset
              </h4><small>with In Song Kim and Soubhik Barari</small>
              <p>  How does democracy shape trade policies? We
              collect 5.7 billion observations of applied tariff
              rates that 136 countries apply to their trading
              partners.  We then develop a Bayesian multilevel
              estimator that distinguishes the effects of regime type
              across industries and trading partners. We find that
              democracies tend to have lower trade barriers than
              non-democracies but are more likely to protect their
              agricultural sectors. Pairs of democracies achieve
              greater tariff reductions than dyads with a democracy and a
              non-democracy because of shallower concessions granted
              by non-democratic importers to their democratic
              partners</p> <p><a href =

                    <p>Does exchanging similar products within the same industry facilitate trade liberalization? To answer this question, we construct a large scale database with more than 300 million observations that links partner specific trade volumes to preferential tariffs rates for each HS6 product. We find strong effects of intra-industry trade on trade liberalization. The effect is especially pronounced for industries with high variation in tariffs. We then focus on the free trade agreement between the U.S. and Korea where more than 60% of products are exported (and imported) by both countries. We find that products with higher levels of two-way trade prior to the agreement enjoyed more reduction of tariffs deviating from the baseline MFN rates.</p>
