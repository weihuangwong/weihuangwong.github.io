        <section class="intro">
            <p>I lead data science teams at NORC at the University of Chicago, developing tools and processes to enhance researcher productivity, data quality, and analytic reproducibility across large-scale surveys in health and education. My work spans the entire data lifecycle—from sampling frame construction to synthetic data generation to program evaluation.</p>

            <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>National Survey of Early Care and Education</h3>
                <p class="period">2018–present</p>
                <p>A nationally representative study characterizing the use and availability of early care and education in the United States. I direct quality assurance activities, lead data archiving efforts, and manage the NSECE Data Desk supporting public-use and restricted-use data files for the research community.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project</h3>
                <p class="period">2023–present</p>
                <p>The largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States. I lead a team of analysts performing analyses for online query tables, interface with data partners to solicit consent for data inclusion, and make recommendations for new data tools serving public health researchers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Synthetic Healthcare Data for Research</h3>
                <p class="period">2019–2021</p>
                <p>A nationally representative all-payer claims dataset that protects privacy through synthetization of sensitive values. I researched and implemented machine learning methods for healthcare data synthesis and led the implementation team developing this novel data product for population health research.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Survey of Doctorate Recipients</h3>
                <p class="period">2018–2019, 2023–present</p>
                <p>A longitudinal study of individuals with U.S. research doctoral degrees in science, engineering, and health fields. I develop automated workflows for data processing, design data monitoring dashboards, and conduct research on adaptive design and nonresponse bias.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I joined NORC at the University of Chicago in 2018, where I have worked on social research in education, health, and transportation. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT, where my research focused on political behavior and housing markets. Prior to graduate school, I managed a global portfolio of fixed income investments for a sovereign wealth fund. I hold a B.A. in Political Science and Economics from Stanford University.</p>
